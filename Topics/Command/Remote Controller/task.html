<h2>Remote Controller</h2>
<html><body><p>Suppose you are building a remote control application. It performs three commands: turning on the TV, changing the channel to a specific number, and turning off the TV. Use the command pattern to implement this application. </p>
<p>Use the following guidelines. </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't change the provided code.</li>
<li>The first command to execute is to turn on the TV. The <code class="java">TurnOn</code> command must print <code class="java">Turning on the TV</code>.</li>
<li>Next, change channels to the inputs given by the user.  The user must give only three inputs. The <code class="java">ChangeChannel</code> command will print <code class="java">Channel was changed to X</code>. X is the number given by the user. </li>
<li>The last command is to turn off the TV. The <code class="java">TurnOff</code> command must print <code class="java">Turning off the TV</code>.</li>
